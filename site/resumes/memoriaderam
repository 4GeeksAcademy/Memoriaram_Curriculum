  summary: |
    I would really love programming, so far I have developed projects in HTML5, CSS and javascript. I am currently training as a Full-Stack Developer and will obtain advanced knowledge in HTML5, CSS, Javascript, React, Python, SQL, Git, among other technologies. I am studying at a great academy called 4 Geek. While I finish these studies, I am looking for a job that allows me to continue my development, practice and grow in the programming sector.
    I feel that if I finish my studies I will be able to develop applications. In my previous jobs and life experiences I have learned to be perseverant, to provide support and implement software for SME companies. 
    I would like to finish learning English, I learn quickly and I know how to work in a team or independently. 
    I really want to learn, practice and grow as a programmer.
